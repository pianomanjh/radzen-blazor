# Slim read-only Radzen grid — build spec

Everything here is derived from measurements in `README.md` in this folder. Where a decision was made,
the reason and the number behind it are given, so it can be re-argued rather than merely obeyed.

Read `README.md` first for the raw data. This file is the design that follows from it.

---

## 1. Why a separate component

`RadzenDataGrid` renders 1000 rows x 5 columns in 28,708 KB on master. Optimising it in place got that
to 18,189 KB (-36.6%, shipped in PR #8). The remaining ~55% is structural:

- the `RadzenDataGridRow` component instantiated per row
- the `RenderFragment` returned per cell by `RenderCell`
- the per-row attribute machinery (`RowAttributes`, `RowStyle`, `RowAriaSelected`, the `<tr>` splat)

**Ruled out, with reasons — do not retry these:**

| Idea | Why not |
| --- | --- |
| Move the cell markup into `RadzenDataGridRow`'s loop so no per-cell fragment is needed | `RenderCell` is **self-recursive** — it calls itself for child columns of a composite header (`RadzenDataGrid.razor`, the `else` branch over `childColumns`). Markup in a loop cannot recurse. Flattening it restructures composite-column rendering, which is live (see the `DataGridCompositeColumns` demo). |
| Pass the parent's builder as a `__builder` parameter so a `@code` method can emit markup | Razor only does this for a component's `BuildRenderTree`. For a method in a `@code` block it parses the generic signature as markup — tried it, 124 compile errors. |
| Render rows inline on a fast path, keeping `RadzenDataGridRow` as fallback | Two row-rendering paths to keep in sync forever. Same drift hazard that `/simplify` flagged in `RenderCell`, at much larger scale. |

A separate component is the low-risk route, not the only one: it touches nothing that already works.

## 2. Budget

At 1000 rows x 5 columns, for identical output:

| | Allocated |
| --- | --- |
| `RadzenDataGrid` on master | 28,708 KB |
| `RadzenDataGrid` after PR #8 | 18,189 KB |
| QuickGrid | 370 KB |
| Slim, bare | 220 KB (119 KB with typed columns, §4) |
| Slim, every feature on and every callback wired | 2,601 KB |

Target: under ~1,000 KB for a realistic configuration. Anything above that means a rule in §3 was broken.

## 3. Architecture rules

1. **Rows and cells are written inline** into the grid's own render tree. No component per row, no
   `CascadingValue` per row, no `RenderFragment` returned per cell.
2. **No callback is allocated unless a handler exists.** This is where the budget goes:
   a row click costs ~310 B/row; a cell click ~296 B/**cell**, which at five columns is five times worse.
   Bind `onclick` only when the corresponding `EventCallback.HasDelegate`.
3. **Nothing is paid for when switched off.** Feature costs are conditional, never unconditional. The
   `oncontextmenu` modifiers in `RadzenDataGrid` cost 10.6% of its entire allocation while evaluating to
   `false` on every cell — that is the failure mode to avoid.
4. **Free features are in, not out.** Selection, row-style callbacks and responsive column titles measured
   at *zero* marginal allocation. There is no performance argument for omitting them.

## 4. Column model

Expressions, not string property names. This is both the better ergonomics and the cheaper option:

| Column shape | Allocated (1000x5) |
| --- | --- |
| `Property="Name"` -> `Func<T,object>` | 220.47 KB |
| `Expression<Func<T,TProp>>` -> `AddContent(value)` | 165.78 KB |
| `Expression<Func<T,TProp>>` -> `Func<T,string>` -> `AddContent(string)` | **118.91 KB** |

`RenderTreeBuilder` has no generic `AddContent<T>`, so handing it a value type binds the `object`
overload, which boxes **and then** stringifies. Compile the expression once into a `Func<T,string>` and
only the string is paid for. The naive typed column still pays the box — implement row 3, not row 2.

Shape:

```
abstract class ColumnBase<TItem>
    string Title, CssClass, FormatString        // genuinely strings, leave them alone
    abstract void RenderCell(RenderTreeBuilder b, int seq, TItem item)
    virtual IOrderedQueryable<TItem> ApplySort(IQueryable<TItem> source, bool descending)
    string PropertyPath { get; }                // derived, see below

sealed class PropertyColumn<TItem, TProp> : ColumnBase<TItem>
    Expression<Func<TItem, TProp>> Property
    Expression<Func<TItem, TProp>> SortBy       // optional, defaults to Property
    Expression<Func<TItem, TProp>> GroupBy      // optional, defaults to Property
    Expression<Func<TItem, TProp>> FilterBy     // optional, defaults to Property

sealed class TemplateColumn<TItem> : ColumnBase<TItem>
    RenderFragment<TItem> Template              // ~94 B/cell, see README
```

The column applies its own sort (`ApplySort`), since only it knows `TProp`. Strongly typed, translates to
SQL, and skips the dynamic-LINQ string parse entirely. This is QuickGrid's `GridSort<T>` shape.

### Property path derivation — do not skip this

Four things in the Radzen ecosystem consume property **name strings**, and an `Expression` serves none
of them:

| Consumer | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `LoadDataArgs.OrderBy` | it is a `string` — the whole `LoadData` contract |
| OData | `$orderby=Customer/Name` goes over the wire |
| Settings persistence | `DataGridColumnSettings` keys state by property name across reloads |
| `FilterDescriptor.Property` | a string, and it is what `RadzenDataFilter` emits |

So the expression is the *authored* form and the path is *derived* from it once at init and cached.
Walk `MemberExpression`, stripping any `Convert`/`ConvertChecked` wrapper (the boxed
`Expression<Func<T,object>>` form). Verified working for `p => p.Id`, `p => p.Customer.Name`, and
`p => (object)p.Id`. Radzen has `PropertyAccess.GetProperty(string)` but nothing expression->path;
it is about 20 lines.

**Sharp edge:** a computed expression has no path. `p => p.First + " " + p.Last` renders fine but cannot
sort server-side, round-trip through `LoadData`, or persist. Such a column is **not sortable unless an
explicit `SortBy` (or sort key) is supplied** — make that visible at the call site, as QuickGrid does by
requiring an explicit `GridSort<T>`. Do not silently disable sorting, and do not throw for a
display-only column.

## 5. Data path

- **`Data` (`IEnumerable<T>`/`IQueryable<T>`) is the primary path.** Compose filter/sort/page onto it.
  With `IAsyncQueryExecutor` registered (PR #7) an EF queryable is counted and paged asynchronously.
- **`LoadData` stays**, as the escape hatch for sources that are not composable queryables — REST, OData,
  gRPC, stored procedures. Async `Data` does not replace it; it only removes the need for it with EF.
- **Gate the cost.** Build the `OrderBy` string only when `LoadData.HasDelegate || IsOData`. A grid using
  neither must pay nothing for their existence. (Rule 3.)
- **No dynamic LINQ.** Sorting uses typed expressions; filtering builds predicates with `Expression.Call`.
  Note `Radzen.Blazor` has **no** `System.Linq.Dynamic.Core` package reference — it ships its own
  161-line `DynamicExtensions.cs`. So there is no dependency to avoid, but there is a string-parse cost
  to skip.

## 6. Markup and styling contract

Emit Radzen's class names and the theme applies for free — including custom themes and CSS variables.
Verified against the real stylesheet: rendered geometry matches exactly (header cell 37px, body cell
37px, table 332px).

- Wrapper: `rz-data-grid rz-datatable`
- Table: `rz-grid-table rz-grid-table-fixed rz-grid-table-striped`
- Row: `rz-data-row` — **no alternating class.** Striping is `:nth-child` off the table-level class;
  computing odd/even per row is both wrong and wasted work.
- Cell: `<td role="gridcell" class="rz-cell-data"><span class="rz-cell-data">…</span></td>`
- **Header cell is structurally coupled:** the theme gives `th` `padding: 0` and hangs the header padding
  off a *direct child div*. `th > div > span.rz-column-title > span.rz-column-title-content` is required.
  Without the div the header row renders shorter. Per column, not per row, so it costs nothing.
- Do **not** emit `rz-datatable-scrollable` unless the full nested scrollable structure is there.

## 7. Reuse from Radzen.Blazor

All public and callable from a dependent package:

| Reuse | For |
| --- | --- |
| `QueryableExtension` | filter/sort composition |
| `RadzenPager` | paging UI, drop in as-is |
| `FilterDescriptor`, `SortDescriptor`, `LoadDataArgs`, `DataGridColumnSortEventArgs<T>` | the descriptor/event model, so `LoadData` handlers port unchanged |
| `RadzenComponent` (base) | `Visible`/`Style`/`Attributes`, mouse + context-menu callbacks, culture, localization |
| `ContextMenuService`, `TooltipService`, `DialogService` | ambient services, consumed the normal way |
| `PropertyAccess` | fallback for genuinely dynamic columns |
| themes | shipped as static web assets under `_content/Radzen.Blazor/` |

**Not** reusable: `ClassList` is internal — write a small class-composition helper.

Will not compose: anything typed to `RadzenDataGrid<T>` specifically (`RadzenDropDownDataGrid` embeds a
real one; the column picker and `RadzenDataGridColumn` are grid-specific).

## 8. Packaging

A separate NuGet package depending on `Radzen.Blazor`, in the shape of
`Radzen.Blazor.EntityFrameworkAdapter` (PR #7). Radzen need not adopt anything; offering costs them
nothing. Package name is still **open** — it lands in the namespace, so decide before writing code.

## 9. Verification protocol

Each layer below caught real faults the previous one missed. Use all of them.

1. **Tests** — and check each one *discriminates*: break the thing deliberately and confirm the test
   fails. Several tests written during this work passed whether or not the code was correct.
2. **Markup diff against `RadzenDataGrid`** — `dotnet run --project gridbench -- visual <dir>` writes
   both grids' real HTML. Diff them. This caught a bug where a cell's `style` vanished entirely while
   every test still passed.
3. **Visual pass** — screenshot `compare.html` against the real theme. Caught missing striping and a
   `rz-datatable-scrollable` class that lied about the markup.
4. **Geometry** — `node measure.js` reads rendered sizes back through Playwright. Caught a short header
   row that survived a screenshot being looked at.
5. **Benchmarks** — `--filter "*SlimBench*"` etc. Numbers last: they say nothing about correctness.

## 10. Open decisions

- Package and namespace name.
- Whether virtualization is in scope for v1 (`Virtualize` integration is orthogonal to the render path).
- Whether to support `RadzenDataFilter` interop in v1 (needs string-path filtering, §4).
